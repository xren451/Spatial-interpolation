# AnchorGK: Anchor Station-based Graph Learning Framework for Spatio-Temporal Kriging

This repository contains the code and datasets for the paper "AnchorGK: Anchor Station-based Graph Learning Framework for
Spatio-Temporal Kriging". In this paper, we propose a new method for spatio-temporal kriging considering the sparse spatial distribution of stations and the availability of features at different stations.

The overall architecture can be found on the following figure.
