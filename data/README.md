# Dataset preparation

All of the datasets can be found on [[Baidu Netdisk]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1C4_PmbIozKUaWS53f4_jXA?pwd=ix5h) ( Extraction code: ix5h).

### UScoast

We need to pre-process UScoast dataset. Generate a folder named "UScoast_raw", and put all of the datasets into this folder. Then run "pre_processing_UScoast.py" to get the datasets after pre-processing, and we can generate another folder named "UScoast_processed".

### Shenzhen and Tehiku

For Shenzhen and Tehiku, we can directly put them into data folder.
